		<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br >
		Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.<br >
		All mimsy were the borogroves,<br >
		And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

		The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br >
		Beware the jubjub bird, and shun<br >
		The frumious bandersnatch!</p>
		
		<p>He took his voral sword in hand:<br >
		Long time his manxome foe he sought --<br >
		So he rested by the Tumtum tree,<br >
		And stood awhile in thought.</p>
		
		<p>And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br >
		The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br >
		Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br >
		And burbled as it came!</p>
		
		<p>One, two! One, two! And through and through<br >
		The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br >
		He left it dead, and with its head<br >
		He went galumphing back.</p>
		
		<p>"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br >
		Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br >
		O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"<br >
		He chortled in his joy.</p>
		
		<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br >
		Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.<br >
		All mimsy were the borogroves,<br >
		And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
