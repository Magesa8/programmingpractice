<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br >
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.<br >
All mimsy were the borogroves,<br >
And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
		
<p>Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br >
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br >
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br >
The frumious Bandersnatch!</p>
		
<p>He took his voral sword in hand:<br >
Long time his manxome foe he sought --<br >
So he rested by the Tumtum tree,<br >
And stood awhile in thought.</p>
		
<p>And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br >
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br >
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br >
And burbled as it came!</p>
		
<p>One, two! One, two! And through and through<br >
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br >
He left it dead, and with its head<br >
He went galumphing back.</p>
		
<p>"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br >
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br >
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"<br >
He chortled in his joy.</p>
		
<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br >
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.<br >
All mimsy were the borogroves,<br >
And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
